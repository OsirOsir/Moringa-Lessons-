Databases -  (storage of data). Basically is a structured collection of data that is stored and managed in 
a way that makes it easy to access, manipulate, and update. Think of it as 
a digital filing system that helps organize information, making it available for various tasks like querying, reporting, and analysis. 

Relational Databases()
NoSql Databases


Sqlite3 -  its a file based type of databases, its not based on 

data types = TEXT, Intergers , BLOGS


user information - id, fist_name, last_name, acount_number, location
create new database - sqlite3 <name_of_database>
create
insert values to new table - INSERT INTO <table_name> VALUES(1, "Joseph", "Ngumbau", "Mombasa");
insert multiple users - INSERT INTO <table_name> VALUES(2, "Lee", "Mwangi", "Kakamega"), (3, "Sammy", "Mwaura", "Nakura")

add a new column to a table - ALTER TABLE <table_name> ADD COLUMN <new_column_name> <data_type>;
update data in a table - UPDATE <table_name> SET <column_name> = <new_value>
we can also rename the TABLE NAME  through  ALTER TABLE users RENAME TO bank_users

from this conditions come in i.e 
UPDATE users SET account_number = 010090000100 WHERE id = 1;

Shit data from old table to new Table -  INSERT INTO <new_table_name> (id, first_name, last_name, location) SELECT (id, first_name, last_name, location) FROM <old_table_name>
DROP TABLE is like deleting
